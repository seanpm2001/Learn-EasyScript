&P Project language file 1
&P For: seanpm2001/Learn-EasyScript
&P About:
&P I decided to make EasyScript the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-EasyScript) as EasyScript is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the EasyScript programming language. It only makes sense to EasyScript the official language for this project. It is getting its own, project language file, starting here.
